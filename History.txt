== 0.8.0 / 2012-01-19
  * Fixed some issues so this gem is compatible with ffi-rzmq 
    version 0.9.5 at a minimum.
    
  * Enforce some common-sense defaults in the Configuration
    objects.
    
  * Modify how Queue and Forwarder print their verbose output.
    Uses STDERR.print now so it is 1) thread-safe, and 2) all
    output is printed as a single unit. Prior to this, printing
    data out could get confused because #puts is not thread-safe.
    
  * Saves the reactor name in the thread. This is used for enforcing
    that operations *all* happen on the reactor-thread. Attempts
    to modify the reactor from non-reactor threads will fail
    and print a warning.
    
  * Makes sure to start the logging client from the reactor thread
    to avoid race conditions at startup.
    
  * The exception handler is now passed to Timer objects. If code
    running during a timer execution throws an exception, it is
    caught right away.
    
  * Rescues *all* Exceptions now rather than just StandardError.
  
  * Timer comparison is done via #object_id now rather than its
    former methodology.    
  

== 0.7.1 / 2011-12-9
  * Updated the Devices to use a Device::Configuration instance
    for configuration rather than that long method signature.
    Makes all components conform to this new configuration
    mechanism consistently.
    
  * Removed responsibility for saving XREQ/XREP/DEALER/ROUTER
    routing information from the Server modules. The envelope
    is passed to the callback, so it's the receiver's 
    responsibility to save that routing information if they need
    it.
    
  * Fixed a potential bug where we could call #resume_read or
    #resume_write on a nil socket. A little extra sanity checking
    never hurt anyone.

  * Fixed ZM::Configuration so that subclasses can still see
    and set the parent class' variables when iterating over the
    accessor fields. Took a while to figure out the correct
    metaprogramming techniques, but I learned quite a bit about
    Ruby inheritance, inheritance visibility, etc.

== 0.7.0 / 2011-10-28
  * Created a class for holding Reactor and Server configurations.
    This is much nicer than passing in individual args or a hash.
    
  * Added the ZM::Servers module to make building servers a little
    easier. The biggest improvement is for making servers that
    utilize XREP/ROUTER sockets since the module handles the 
    splitting of the routing envelope messages from the body.
    
  * Fixed a bug where a timer that raises an exception prevented
    other periodical timers from renewing. Thanks to Tim
    Carey-Smith for the bug report!

== 0.6.0 / 2011-10-04
  * Compatibility with ffi-rzmq 0.9.0 and added some conditional
    logic to support 0mq 2.1.x and 3.x APIs.
  
  * Removed all exceptions and replaced them with return codes.

  * Added :exception_handler key to Reactor#new so exceptions can
    be managed by user code.

== 0.5.2 / 2011-07-21
  * Added PUSH and PULL socket types. Never needed them until now.
  * Added a +context+ reader to the Reactor class.
  * Changed default behavior for all sockets to use ZMQ:LINGER 1
    as a socket option. By default, this prevents a call to
    #close from hanging forever if there are unsent messages in
    queue.
  * Expose #logger accessor (read-only). 
  * Refactored Reactor#log so that most of the work is performed in 
    the LogClient (tell, don't ask!).
  * Added LogClient#puts so that a logger instance can be passed to
    other objects who expect an IO-like object that responds to #puts.
    
== 0.5.1 / 2011-05-03
  * Added Reactor#oneshot_timer_at for scheduling a timer to fire at
    an exact time.
  * Changed Reactor#next_tick to use #shift instead of #pop for running
    blocks. Originally it was running the blocks in the reverse order
    that #next_tick was called. Blocks are now run in the *same* order
    as they were created by a call to #next_tick.
  * Added a timestamp to all messages created using Reactor#log.
  
== 0.5.0 / 2011-03-3
  * Changed the constructor for the ZM::Reactor class. It now takes
    an optional third hash argument. One of the keys that it uses
    is :zeromq_context. This allows a user to create a master 0mq
    context and share it with multiple reactors. The point of that is
    to allow the use of the :inproc transport. That transport is
    somewhat misnamed since it only allows "inprocess" communication
    between sockets created by the same context. I needed :inproc to
    work around a 0mq memory leak (still unfixed) and discovered this
    issue.
    A second key is :log_transport which is used by the logging
    facility.
    In the future, the first two arguments to ZM::Reactor will likely
    be rolled into the hash argument. That will be a backwards-
    incompatible change, so I'm hoping folks read these notes and
    start preparing.
  * Many fixes to ZM::Timers. Cancellation is more intelligent about
    matching timers. Inspection of timers also provides better detail
    about their contents. Lastly, expired timer removal is much clearer
    in how it functions *and* it is faster by an order of magnitude.
    (Note: Array#shift is *way faster* than Array#delete_at(0)).
  * Timer expiration has changed. Originally, timers fired only when
    the current time was *greater than* its firing time. Now timers
    fire when the current time is *greater than or equal to* its firing
    time.
  * Modified how arguments are passed to the Forwarder and Queue
    devices.
  * Devices now default to a ZMQ::LINGER of 0 (drop messages
    immediately upon socket close) and a ZMQ::HWM of 1 (only allow
    1 outstanding message between senders and receivers). These
    parameters can be modified using the new argument hash.
  * ZM::Address now supports the :inproc transport.
  * Fixed a memory leak where a message was not released when an
    internal recv operation returned EAGAIN. The code was leaking an
    empty ZMQ::Message every time.
  * Added a facility for logging. When a Reactor is instantiated a
    user may pass in a transport string that indicates where the
    reactor may *connect* and publish log messages. Part of the
    contract is that this transport already has a listener bound
    to it before the connection is attempted (e.g. for inproc
    transports). If inproc is used, then the user also needs to 
    pass in the shared context via :zeromq_context.
  * Fixed a bug in Socket#send_messages where EAGAIN was not always
    properly detected and bubbled up to its caller.
  * Refactored socket deletion. Hopefully it is easier to understand.
    
== 0.4.1 / Unreleased

== 0.4.0 / 2010-12-16
  * Replaced SortedSet in Timers with an Array and a custom routine
    for finding the in-order index for an insert. The routine
    uses a binary search algo so it can find the proper index in
    O(nlog n) time. This resulted in a 2 order of magnitude perf
    increase when using more than a handful of timers.
  * Modified the default reactor poll interval to 10ms from 100usec.
    Also, fixed the poll routine so that it sleeps for poll_interval
    when there are no procs scheduled and there are no sockets
    registered. With no sockets, the call to Poller#poll returns
    immediately. This was showing as a busy loop and pushing CPU
    to 100% for some users.
    With this change, timers now have a minimum *default* resolution
    of 10 milliseconds. The poll interval can be overridden and set to
    a minimum of 1ms for better timing controls.

== 0.3.2 / 2010-08-25
  * Fixed a bug in Timers where the timers were never getting removed
    after they fired. Bug was caused by a Ruby bug with #delete_if. While
    deleting each fired timer, the delete_if loop was exited early via
    a call to #break as an optimization. The #break caused all deletes to
    be ignored.
    See bug http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2545
  * Minor fixes to the ping-pong examples. Was missing some calls to
    register/deregister for read/write events. The socket semantics have
    changed since earlier revisions; those changes didn't get caught until
    now.

== 0.3.1 / 2010-08-16
  * Forgot to load the xreq/xrep files during startup
  * Added support for resetting a timer's firing schedule. Useful for when
    the time source has been overridden; let's existing timers
    reschedule themselves using the new time source.
  * Fixed a logic bug with delivery of multi-part messages

== 0.3.0 / 2010-08-15
  * Added XREQ/XREP socket types
  * Moved the time functions for ZM::Timers into a pair of
    class methods. Instead of accessing Time directly, it should
    be accessed via ZM::Timers.now and ZM::Timers.now_converted.
    Doing so allows the programmer to reopen the ZM::Timers class and
    redefine how time is procured if necessary (e.g. every second of
    wall clock time should translate to 1 minute of time inside the
    reactor).
  * Still needs specs!

== 0.2.0 / 2010-06-06
  * Updated internals to conform to the 0mq api as of
  release 2.0.7.

  * Minor api enhancements.

== 0.1.0 / 2010-06-02

* 1 major enhancement
  * Birthday!
